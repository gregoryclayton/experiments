 - the log files are just fake network log dumps
 - the scripts and teh whole project really is inspired by mr. robot, <br>
   still a favorite to this day<br>
- there's a few extra scripts that didn't make it into the final cut too.

- initially the whole thing was running on a virtual machine instance<br>
of kali linux to be real authentic to source, but all that going<br>
plus OBS to capture was too much for my little laptop, so I made<br>
a custom desktop running on cracked inwdows instead
